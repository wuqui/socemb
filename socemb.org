* Plan
** corpus: political sphere on Reddit

** measure diachronic semantic variation
- to get sample of semantic change / neologisms
- across all communities

** measure social semantic variation at late stage
- distance of semantic representations (=vectors=) for each of the candidates (=sample=)

** measure social distances of communities
- community labels from =userleansbot=
- social embeddings [[parencite:Martin2017DissectingTrump]]

** analyse correlation between social distance and social semantic variation

** analyse temporal dynamics
*** semantic variation: increasing polarisation?
*** social distance: increasing polarisation?
*** does one drive the other?
